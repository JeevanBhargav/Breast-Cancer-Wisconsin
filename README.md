# Project 1: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set - Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant

This is a project for my Principle of Data Management and Mining class, where I worked on the breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv dataset to predict whether a breast cancer instance is benign or malignant.
In this project, I explored the dataset to identify features and the class attribute, handled missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features, and converted pandas DataFrames to numpy arrays. I then applied various machine learning techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and Naive Bayes, to build models and measured their accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation.
Finally, I experimented with different hyperparameters for KNN and SVM to see how they affect the model's accuracy. I have included the Python source code in .py, output of the source code including both preprocessing and modeling steps, answers to each question in step 2, and a conclusion regarding the results.
